recipeingredient:
- "2 cups peeled and grated laukibottlegourd"
- "1/2 cup powdered jaggery unrefined cane sugar"
- "1/2 teaspoon elaichi powdercardamom powder"
- "6-8 cashew nuts"
- "4 tablespoons ghee"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and grate lauki and place in a pressure pan. Add about ½ to ¾ cups of water, mix and cook on pressure for about 2 whistles."
- "Once the pressure drops, open the pan and cook the bottle gourd on medium high until most of the moisture is gone. If you do not have a pressure pan, just cook the gourd in an open pan until all the moisture evaporates. Add jaggery and 2 tablespoons of ghee and mix well."
- "Cook again on medium high, stirring continuously until the moisture is almost gone; add more ghee if you want a richer halwa. Once most of the moisture is gone and you get a thick mixture with ghee glistening from the edges of the halwa, stir in cardamom powder and give it a good stir. Remove from heat. In a small saucepan, heat rest of the ghee and add cashew nuts; fry until light golden brown. Tip this into the halwa and mix well."
- "Transfer into serving bowls, garnish with additional cashew nuts and serve hot or cold."
- "Choose tender bottle gourds to make halwa. I found a few seeds in the lauki I had. They were tender, so I decided to use them in the halwa to give a different texture to the dessert. If you do not like the seeds or they are hard, you can remove them while grating."
- "Adjust the amount of jaggery according to your taste. If you cannot find jaggery, you can add plain white sugar to sweeten this halwa. For a richer taste, add khoya or grated paneer to the halwa while it is cooking. #cookingwithjaggery"
