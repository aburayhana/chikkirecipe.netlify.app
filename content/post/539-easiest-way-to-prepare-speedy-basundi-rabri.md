Hey everyone, it is John, welcome to my recipe site. Today, I'm gonna show you how to make a distinctive dish, basundi / rabri. One of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

Basundi also known as Rabri in some parts of India is a creamy rich dessert, is prepared especially during the festivities of Kali Chaudas and just about every small function or a party.
