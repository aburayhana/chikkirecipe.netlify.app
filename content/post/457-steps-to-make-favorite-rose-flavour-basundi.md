- "Then add the chopped almond, Pista &amp; cashew (as I didn&#39;t have cashew at home, so I have skipped, you can add that too) and cook for another 5 minutes. Your Basundi is ready. Put it in a serving bowl and garnish it beautifully with more nuts and dried rose petals (optional). Chill and serve."
