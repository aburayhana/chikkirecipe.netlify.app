- "Line a baking tray or pan with aluminum foil. this method makes its easier to clean the pan later."
- "Thread the paneer cubes on a bamboo or metal skewers and place them on the prepared pan. preheat the oven to 200 degrees celsius/390 degrees fahrenheit for at least 10 minutes before you grill the tikkas. for a regular oven, keep both the top and bottom elements on and keep the pan in the center rack. for a microwave oven use the convection mode and preheat at 180 degrees celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit."

- "Grill the paneer in an preheated oven at 200 degrees C/390 degrees fahrenheit for 15-25 minutes (depending on the oven temperatures). i have a really slow oven, so it took 28 mins for the paneer cubes to be grilled and browned at the edges. just keep an eye when the paneer is getting grilled in the oven. for a microwave oven in the convection mode, use 180 degrees celsius/350 degrees fahrenheit for grilling the tikka."

- "Boil water with a pinch of salt. add halved onions and tomatoes to the boiling water. cook for one or two minutes. switch off. cover and keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes. you can also add cashews to the hot water. adding cashews gives a creamier consistency with a nice sweetness. later drain and chop the onions and tomatoes roughly. its not necessary to blanch, but blanching reduces the cooking time later."
- "Later chop the onions roughly and make a smooth fine paste in a grinder or blender."
- "Peel and roughly chop the tomatoes. make a smooth puree of the tomatoes in the grinder or blender. keep both the onion &amp; tomato puree aside."
- "Whisk or beat the yogurt till smooth and keep aside. there should be no lumps in the yogurt and it should be beaten well."

- "Add ginger garlic paste and saute till the raw aroma of ginger-garlic goes away."
- "Add the tomato puree. stir well and saute till you see fat leaving sides of the masala."
- "Now add all the dry spice powders - turmeric, red chili powder, coriander powder and garam masala/tandoori masala."
- "Stir well so that the spices are incorporated in the masala paste evenly."
- "Now remove the pan from the fire. add beaten fresh curd/yogurt. removing the pan from fire, won&#39;t allow the yogurt to curdle. use full fat and fresh curd."
- "Stir well. add water and salt. stir again."
- "Simmer for 5 to 6 minutes or till the gravy thickens and you see fat floating on the top. you can keep the consistency from medium to slightly thick. the consistency can be altered by adding more or less water."
- "Add cream and kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves). stir well and simmer on a low flame for a minute. check the taste and add more salt or cream if you prefer. you can also about ½ to 1 tsp of sugar for a light sweet taste."
