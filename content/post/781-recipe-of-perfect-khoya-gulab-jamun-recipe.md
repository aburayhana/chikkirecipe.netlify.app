recipeinstructions:

Cover with a damp cover and let the dough rest for 30 mins. Making sugar syrup for Gulab Jamun While the dough is resting, in a bowl, add sugar, water, card"
- "Making Gulab Jamun balls Grease your palms with some ghee. With your hands, knead the whole dough once."
- "Make small balls from the dough. Do not apply too much pressure while making the balls. When rolling to balls, make sure the balls are smooth with no cracks, else they might break when frying.  The balls will increase in size after frying &amp; soaking in syrup. Make equal sized balls,"
- "Frying and soaking the Gulab Jamun Heat the ghee/oil well in a fry pan/wok before starting to fry the balls. Fry on medium-low heat. On high heat, they will get dark from the outside, but will not be cooked well from the inside."
- "Add them to the syrup while the syrup is warm (not boiling hot), so they soak in all the sweetness and become soft. If the syrup is too hot, the balls might break. If it is cold, then the balls will not soak the syrup well. Soak for at least 30 minutes before enjoying. Soaking for up to 2-3 hours works great too. Gulab Jamuns are ready to be enjoyed."
